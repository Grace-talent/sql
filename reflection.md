Reflecting on my previous work, particularly in data analysis and technical projects, I recognize that incorporating ethics and addressing inequity is essential 
to ensuring responsible and fair outcomes. In the context of data handling, ethical concerns include privacy, fairness, transparency, and the potential societal 
impact of data-driven decisions. Historically, much of the work in data science focuses on technical accuracy and efficiency, but without a thoughtful approach to 
ethics, we risk perpetuating biases and inequalities.

One area where I would adjust my work is in addressing the inherent biases in data sets. Many databases reflect existing social inequalities, whether in
representation, access to services, or financial inclusion. To tackle this, I would place a greater emphasis on auditing data for biases, especially when filtering,
segmenting, or making predictions that might affect marginalized groups. Additionally, ensuring that data collection practices are inclusive and representative of
all demographic segments would help mitigate unintended exclusions or reinforce systemic disparities.

Beyond data biases, ensuring transparency in how algorithms make decisions is another ethical component I would incorporate more explicitly. When analyzing or 
automating processes, such as in anti-money laundering (AML) work, itâ€™s critical to ensure that the algorithms are explainable and that their decisions can be 
traced back to clear, ethical criteria. This would involve rethinking the design of queries and models to make sure they do not inadvertently disadvantage certain 
groups or reinforce existing inequities, such as access to financial services or disproportionate scrutiny.

By consciously integrating ethics and equity into my approach, I can contribute to creating data-driven solutions that are not only efficient but also socially 
just. This includes a more careful evaluation of how the outcomes of my work affect different populations, making fairness a central priority in both the data and 
processes I develop.
